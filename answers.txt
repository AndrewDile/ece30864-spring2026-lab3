Pros
1. Breaks down a project into achievable parts and stages so that they can be organized and tracked independently, as well as released incrementally.
2. Helps quantify how long projects or parts of projects may take, and allows all to access and view the efficiency of teams and members.
Cons
1. Takes a while to set up, especially if the project is already underway, and can be hard to move from big deadlines to smaller sprint ideology.
2. Requires everyone to follow the standards, and requires a high level of discipline to manage the constant communication and upkeep.
